	  <p>For the last 3 years, I have been developing a portfolio to display my ability to create interactive experiences of my own designs. I started my journey at Havering Sixth Form College in September 2021 when I started my Creative Media Practice course earning 3 Distinction*'s at the end of the 2 year course. At that college, I learned the basics to various parts of the Game Development process such as concept art, mechanics design/scripting, and 3D modelling. I learned how to use the Unity and Stencyl game engines to make a total of 4 full games while there. I also learned how to model in Blender to create assets for my 3D games</p>
									<p>After successfully completing my course in college, I moved on to attend Staffordshire University with an unconditional offer taking Game Development BSc taking 6 modules in the first year and currently having completed 2 more modules in my second year. These modules so far taught me how to use various software to aid the production process. These softawres include: Unreal Engine, 3DS Max, Substance Painter and Substance Designer. I also learned how to code in C++ for a text based game and Unreal Engine.</p>

									<p>My first time using Unity to make a complete project and my task was to create a portfolio showing off work completed throughout the course such as blender models, animations, and previous games. I also included a separate game which I made for fun during my free time called "Collect the Dales" (listed under the "Extra Projects" section) to show off extra mechanics development skills I made over the course.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
