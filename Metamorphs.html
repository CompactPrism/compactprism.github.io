	  <p>My first main project for my game development journey started with Metamorphs. I made this 2D platformer based around the idea of transforming into different animals across different levels.It features 4 playable animals (cat, bird, kangaroo, fish) and they all have different movement mechanics and roles in their levels.&nbsp; </p>

												<h3>Cat Level</h3>
										<p>In the first 3 levels, the player plays as a cat and this plays like a normal 2D platformer jumping on top of enemies while going to the right side of the map. The player can also climb up walls allowing for verticallity in the level design.</p>
									<h3>Bird Level</h3>
									<p>When playing as the bird, the player is constantly moving towards the right while descending. I was inspired by Flappy Bird's simple mechanics but could not figure out how to fully recreate it in time so I settled with the player holding an ascend/descend button to slowly go higher/lower to avoid obstacles like buildings and other birds.</p>
									<h3>Kangaroo Level</h3>
									<p>This mechanic was inspired by the Google Dinosaur game where the player is constantly moving to the right and gaining speed while jumping over obstacles. This level wasn't as fleshed out as I wanted it to be as I wanted a charge up jump to happen but I instead had a double jump mechanic which is slightly buggy.</p>
									<h3>Fish Level</h3>
									<p>The fish mechanic is just a simple 8-directional movement and was used to make the player traverse a maze. This maze features enemies which will charge towards the player when in range&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
